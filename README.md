# GTIL2LCD
This code will decode the LCD data stream on a SUN-1000GTIL2 inverter.
It will probably work on the 2000W model though I don't have one to check.
It just prints the decoded data to the serial terminal. You will need to add to the code if you want to send it elsewhere.

Be safe around the inverter as it has lethal voltages inside. Do not open the inverter if you don't understand these risks.

There is no warranty and no liability for the use of this code.
